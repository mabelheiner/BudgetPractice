# BudgetPractice
# Overview

This is a program that will help people budget and save money for big items. It asks the user 
for an item and a price and plans out their budget to let them know in how many months they can 
purchase said item.

We all have things that we want that cost a lot of money. Even though we may want these things 
it can be hard to know how much to save each month. It is a pain
to calculate how much time it will take to save for our desired items.
I created this program to analyze and calculate the user's spending habits 
and help them budget for future big purchases.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I coded this program in IntelliJ IDEA. 

I used the Kotlin programming language to make this program. Kotlin is 
a programming language that is typically used for the frontend of applications.
